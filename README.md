🎲 Dice Game — JavaScript Mini Project

A simple yet interactive Dice Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project was created to strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.

Though simple, it demonstrates how core frontend concepts come together to build a functional and engaging user experience.

🚀 Project Overview

The Dice Game simulates rolling dice for players and dynamically displays the winner based on the dice values.
Each refresh or button click generates new random dice values, making the game interactive and fun.
